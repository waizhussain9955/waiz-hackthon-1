# AI-Native Textbook: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Core Principles

1. **Human-Agent-Robot Symbiosis**: Focus on the partnership between people, software agents, and physical robots.
2. **AI-Native Pedagogy**: Content designed for AI-assisted learning (using Claude Code & Agents).
3. **Practical Rigor**: Theory balanced with actionable, deployable code examples.
4. **Future-Ready Skills**: Curriculum aligned with the "Future of Work" demands.

## Key Standards

- **Tech Stack**: Docusaurus (framework), Spec-Kit Plus (scaffolding), Claude Code (generation)
- **Output Format**: Markdown-based documentation deployed to GitHub Pages
- **Structure**: Modular chapters, clear learning objectives, and interactive code blocks
- **Audience**: Technical learners (O/A Level, Engineering, Medical backgrounds)

## Constraints

- **Tooling**: Must strictly use Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code
- **Platform**: Static site hosting via GitHub Pages
- **Content**: Intersection of physical hardware control and AI agent logic

## Success Criteria

1. **Deployment**: Zero-error build accessible via public GitHub Pages URL
2. **Completeness**: Full course curriculum covered in Docusaurus structure
3. **Scalability**: Architecture allows for future AI-agent integration (reading/learning)

## Workflow Steps

// turbo-all

1. Configure `docusaurus.config.ts` for the AI-Native Textbook branding
2. Structure the `docs/` folder with modular curriculum chapters
3. Create learning objectives and content for each chapter
4. Add interactive code blocks with Python/robotics examples
5. Configure GitHub Pages deployment
6. Build and verify zero-error deployment
